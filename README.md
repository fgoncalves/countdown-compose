## :scroll: Description

Countdown timer with a clear indicator of how long is left. You can count down from hours to seconds!

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

My ultimate goal is to learn bit by bit how compose actually handles the different UI scenarios I
often encounter in Android development.

In this particular challenge, my main goal was to learn how composition and recomposition affect state in compose. I've tried to
keep the ui to a bare minimum and focus on state handling and ended up with pretty much a copy of the system timer.

I also wanted to learn how viewmodels fit into the mix and can handle the state internally.
